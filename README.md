# DeepSight DR: Deep Learning-Powered Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

> An AI-powered, scalable, and accessible solution for early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using InceptionV2 & InceptionV3 CNN architectures.

## 🚀 Overview

DeepSight DR is a deep learning-based system for classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity from retinal fundus images. It uses CNN models—InceptionV2 and InceptionV3—enhanced with transfer learning and a robust preprocessing pipeline to enable accurate detection across five severity levels. The system is scalable, web-deployable, and future-ready for edge/mobile devices.
